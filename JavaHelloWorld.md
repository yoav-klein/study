# Java

*Java platform* contains two components:
- Java Virtual Machine
- Java API

The *JVM* is what runs the compiled *Bytecode*. <br>
The API is a ready-made software components that are ready for use by the programmer. <br>
It's grouped into libraries, called *Packages*, of related classes and interfaces. 

```java
/**
*  The HelloWorldApp class implements an application that
* simply prints "Hello World"
*/

class HelloWorldApp {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```
